## Our plan / approach

We first made a draft plan on Trello and assigned each team member with basic simple tasks to start building the mainframe, then we pushed and merged our individual works to Github. After the merge, we had a long debugging session just to make sure the MVP is working. Once the main structure is done, we then added other functions and features.

## lessons learned

Use of Github for collaborative projects, eg. pull and push from gitlord, fetch, rebase and merge.
Building single page app using express, psql-database, and nodemon.
Team coding, group
